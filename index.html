      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Hi! I'm Ritayush Suchismita Dey, a 16-year-old high school student and developer from India. I've been programming for over 6 years and have built more than 100 projects throughout my learning journey. <br><br>

Beyond technology, I have a strong interest in environmental sustainability and in uncovering the truths behind commonly accepted narratives. I believe that meaningful change begins with accurate information, critical thinking, open discussion, and expertise. Through my work, I aim to combine technology, research, and communication to challenge misconceptions, promote awareness, and help people engage more thoughtfully with the environmental issues that shape our future. <br><br>

I hope you find this platform insightful and empowering, and that it encourages you to question, learn, and contribute toward a more informed and sustainable world.
